I am a final year PhD candidate in geology at Indiana University Bloomington. 
My work focuses on the dynamics and evolution of rivers in mountain landscapes. 
I like to tackle complex problems that span multiple space and time scales by using 
novel combinations of observational data, numerical modeling, and field geology. 

I have >5 years of experience writing code for data analysis, statistics, and probability. 
I am experienced in both implementing out of the box model and data software as well as developing my own. 
I commonly use large datasets from both public and proprietary sources. 

I am passionate about what I do - I strive to see the big picture, find solutions with both novel and traditional data sources, 
and to communicate my results clearly to broad and varied audiences.
